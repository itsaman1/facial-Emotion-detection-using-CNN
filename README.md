Facial Emotion Detection using CNN
Overview
This repository contains code for Facial Emotion Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to analyze and classify emotions in facial expressions.


## Introduction

Facial Emotion Detection is a computer vision task that involves recognizing and classifying emotions based on facial expressions. This project aims to provide a solution for automatically detecting emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., in facial images using Convolutional Neural Networks.
## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

1. Python 3.x
2. NumPy
3. OpenCV
4. TensorFlow
5. Keras
## Model Training

If you wish to train the model on a different dataset or fine-tune the existing model, you can use the train.py script. Ensure you have the dataset in the appropriate format before running the script.

python train.py --dataset_path path/to/dataset --epochs 10

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the trained model, you can use the evaluate.py script:

python evaluate.py --test_dataset_path path/to/test_dataset
